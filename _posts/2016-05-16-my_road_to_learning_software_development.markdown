I think my interest in programming and software development started in high school. I took a course in computer science and enjoyed it, but then went on to study different things in college. I never knew what I wanted to do for a living, and everything just seemed so distant that I wouldn't ever have to worry about it. 

A time finally came in my life when I had to take a hard look at they kind of person I wanted to be and the type of life I wanted. I had been working at a large natural grocery chain for a few years and worked my way into an assistant team leader position. Up until that point, my entire career plan was to work my way to store leader. I had learned a lot from my previous mentors, and was putting in the time, hard work, and dedication. My team leader at that time, however, did not value me. He wasn't utilizing any of my skills that I had worked so hard to learn and was refusing to teaching me anything new. I felt trapped and started considering my other options. 

I quickly realized that I had been placing my trust and my future in the hands of a large corporation that cared very little about me. If I wanted to progress and make a career and lifestyle that I could be proud of, I would have to invest in myself. I needed skills that would make me valuable. 

Software development became a clear choice to me. I took some free online intro courses and realized I enjoyed it. I also appreciate that I can show a certain level of creativity and elegance in my projects. I always think there is something amazingly satisifying about a well written and efficient piece of code. Most importantly, software development is the chance for me to build a career and lifestyle with something I am passionate about.
